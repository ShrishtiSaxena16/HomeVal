# House-Price-Prediction-System
A house price prediction system uses previously recorded data and different algorithms to estimate how much a house is worth based on its size and various features.
This system makes use of scikit-learn, a robust Python library for machine learning. It utilizes regression algorithm Linear Regression. 

First step is preprocessing the data, which involves cleaning, scaling, and encoding categorical variables. It then splits the dataset into training and testing sets to train the regression model. During training, the algorithms learn patterns and relationships between the input features and house prices.

After training, the model is evaluated using metrics such as  R-squared to assess its predictive performance. 

Once all the steps are performed, the system can make predictions on new data estimating the market value of a house based on its several features.
